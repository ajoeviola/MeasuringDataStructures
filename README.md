# Measuring Data Structures

## Description 
A C++ Application that measures the performance of several sorting algorithms in terms of number of steps and CPU running time.
This Application was the final project for a Data Structures course. The application measures the performance of different implementations of 
insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quicksort. It tests the performance of these algorithms while they are sorted,
 reversely sorted, and called with random permutations. For each algorithm, the average running time and average number of steps for 50 randomly generated 
 instances are calculated.
